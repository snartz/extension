Please follow these guidelines when revising the code:

1. Add comments that describe function description and parameteres passed 

2. Use proper indentations. Indentation should be used to separate blocks of code, such as inside a function definition or inside a control structure (like if, for, while etc.).

3. Control structures (if, for, etc.) should not be written on the same line as their parent function or control structure. Each should be on a separate line.

4. Do not write multiple statements on the same line. Each statement should be on its own line.

5. Use spaces around operators. This improves readability.

6. Make sure all variable and function names are descriptive. Single-letter variable names should be avoided.

7. Always include an explicit return statement in a function, even if the function is not expected to return a value.
